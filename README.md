# Coordinator

## Overview

The coordinator app helps you coordinate times you can meet with your friends! How? By combining your google calendars (with some built in privacy).

### Problem Space

In this day and age people are finding it difficult to find a time when they are all free. This app provides an easy visual of when everyone is available, making it easy to coordinate activities with multiple people.

### User Profile

Who will use your app? How will they use it? Add any special considerations that your app must take into account.

### Features

List the functionality that your app will include. These can be written as user stories or descriptions with related details. Do not describe _how_ these features are implemented, only _what_ needs to be implemented.

## Implementation

### Tech Stack

List technologies that will be used in your app, including any libraries to save time or provide more functionality. Be sure to research any potential limitations.

### APIs

List any external sources of data that will be used in your app.

### Sitemap

List the pages of your app with brief descriptions. You can show this visually, or write it out.

### Mockups

Provide visuals of your app's screens. You can use pictures of hand-drawn sketches, or wireframing tools like Figma.

### Data

One table of groups and the user ids of each group member. 

A table for each user, with their unique user id and calendar events pulled from Google API. 


### Endpoints

List endpoints that your server will implement, including HTTP methods, parameters, and example responses.

## Roadmap

Scope your project as a sprint. Break down the tasks that will need to be completed and map out timeframes for implementation working back from the capstone due date.
